\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First of all, I want to thank my supervisor, Are Raklev, for practical advice on my master's thesis. The contextual explanations of the underlying physics and its pertinent challenges have provided me with precisely the amount of knowledge necessary to carry out the work in this thesis. I have enjoyed your calm nature and your diligent obsession with typography that has likely elevated the quality of this thesis. I also want to thank Anders Kvellestad for serving as my unofficial co-advisor. You have taken time to have lengthy discussions of various related topics investigated in this thesis.

I will never forget the friends I gained through my studies. I want to thank you all for enhancing my experience and contributing to my growth as a human. It has been a pleasure to learn about the inner-workings of Mother Nature beside you. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. A special thanks to Toshi for awesome long nights working through our bachelor's courseload and long walks after late nights out, to Bennern for emotional support and wisdom to carry out life-changing decisions, to Mærri for your friendship and the christmas celebration I got to spend with your family, to Kæsp for your inability to stop talking and being the life-of-the-party, to Unis for being the best labpartner I could ever get and unexpectedly arranging a celebration for my birthday last year, to my boy TK for being my ``homie'' for more than 20 years, to Izzi and Carrion for your unfiltered speech and so many more. Rest assured, besides a couple examinators, no one will read this thesis. Thus if your name is omitted, no one will ever know.

A final thanks to the Norwegian government for allowing me the opportunity to pursue an education of high quality at no cost and for the computing resources used in this thesis. Now that we are mentioning education, thanks to every single person through history that has dedicated their life to understanding nature and progressing our collective base of knowledge. Without them, there would be no education to speak of.
