In this chapter, we shall discuss the need for application of machine learning models in physics problems
and why this is a necessary solution.

 
\section{Computation of Beyond the Standard Model Cross Sections}
The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is a successful fundamental theory that describes fundamental particles and their interactions.
Despite its success, however, it has a few limitations on its own which has led physicists to propose extentions to the model to explain physics that SM cannot. One such family of extensions is called \textit{supersymmetry}.
