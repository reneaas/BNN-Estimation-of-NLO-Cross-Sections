Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is considered a state-of-the-art sampling method, 
but suffers the need for manual tuning of the number of leapfrog steps $L$
and the step size $h$. In this chapter, we'll study a sampling method called \textit{The No-U-Turn sampler} \cite{} built upon
HMC that dynamically adapts the number of leapfrog steps.
